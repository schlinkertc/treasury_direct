# treasury_direct
interacting with the Treasury Direct API 

The jupyter notebook in this repo represents my first attempts at interacting with the Treasury Direct API.

## Goals for this project include 
- Regression analysis to predict return and/or understand the effects of different variables 
- Seamlessly parsing and storing municipal finance data in a relational database for future analysis
